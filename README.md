# StyleTrasfer

This notebook demonstrates the implementation of style transfer using the VGG-19 neural network architecture. Style transfer is a technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another to create visually appealing and artistically stylized images.

**Datasets**

The images on which the style transfer was performed were collected from the dataset at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/soumikrakshit/images-for-style-transfer
The images whose style was transferred were collected from the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tamajitbhattacharjee/neural-style-transfer
